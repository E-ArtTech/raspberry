# GPIOZero Button Class Example Codes

## Example 1: Simple Button Press
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2)
button.wait_for_press()
print("Button was pressed!")

## Example 2: Button Hold Event
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2)
def hold():
    print("Button is being hold")
button.when_held = hold

## Example 3: Button Release Event
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2)
def released():
    print("Button was released")
button.when_released = released

## Example 4: Button Press with Callback
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2)
def pressed():
    print("Button pressed")
button.when_pressed = pressed



## Example 5: Button with Debounce
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2, bounce_time=0.1)
def pressed():
    print("Debounced button press")
button.when_pressed = pressed

## Example 6: Button Press Count
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2)
press_count = 0
def pressed():
    global press_count
    press_count += 1
    print(f"Button pressed {press_count} times")
button.when_pressed = pressed

## Example 7: Button Hold with Hold Time
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2, hold_time=2)
def held():
    print("Button held for 2 seconds")
button.when_held = held

## Example 8: Button Double Press
from gpiozero import Button
from signal import pause
button = Button(2)
def double_press():
    print("Button double-pressed")
button.when_pressed = double_press
pause()

## Example 9: Button with LED Toggle
from gpiozero import Button, LED
button = Button(2)
led = LED(17)
button.when_pressed = led.toggle

## Example 10: Button with Multiple Actions
from gpiozero import Button
button = Button(2)
def pressed():
    print("Button pressed")
def released():
    print("Button released")
button.when_pressed = pressed
button.when_released = released

## Example 10:IR sensor 
from gpiozero import MotionSensor, LED
from signal import pause
pir = MotionSensor(4)
led = LED(16)
pir.when_motion = led.on
pir.when_no_motion = led.off
pause()
